# Description
Since it got more complicated for regular users to order S/MIME certificates after most browsers removed the <keygen> option, Xolphin decided to create their own 'Xolphin Certificate Tool', to ease the S/MIME and Code Signing ordering process. 

The Xolphin Certificate Tool provides the following features;

## Ordering
- Order a single personal, company personal or company department S/MIME certificate (Issued by Sectigo)
- Order a batch of company personal or company department S/MIME certificates (Issued by Sectigo)
- Order a single Code Signing Certificate (Issued by Sectigo)

## Installing
- Install a single S/MIME certificate via it's collection code
- Install a batch of S/MIME certificates via a list of collection codes
- Automatically collect and install Code Signing Certificates ordered through this program

## Exporting
- Export a keypair as PEM (cert & key) or PFX

## Administration
- View certificate store contents without requiring the MMC
